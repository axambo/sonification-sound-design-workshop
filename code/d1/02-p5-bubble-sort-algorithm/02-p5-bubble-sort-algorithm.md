#Exercise challenge: Bubble Sort Algorithm Sonification

Learning outcome: Understanding processes / algorithms using sonification techniques.

Goal: Apply a sonification technique to a classical sorting algorithm to understand the process.

Steps:

1. Implement the bubble sort visualization algorithm as explained here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67k3I2GxTH8
2. Add sounds to the process from the p5.js sound library.
